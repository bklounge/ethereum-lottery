# ethereum-lottery
This is a decentralized ethereum lottery contract where individuals can enter into a lottery. A winner can be pseudo randomly chosen by the manager (one who deployed the contract). I've deployed an instance to the Rinkeby test net. See my repo, "lottery-react" for a super basic, react front end to interact with this contract.
